# Monopoly Express

## Overview
Monopoly Express is a condensed and engaging version of the classic board game Monopoly, designed to be shorter while maintaining the essence of buying, selling, and competing to become the wealthiest player. The game incorporates a linear board, unique obstacles, interactive trolls, and mini-games to ensure an immersive and dynamic experience.

## Features
- **Linear Game Board**: A simplified, non-looping board with a defined end point.
- **Interactive Obstacles**: Players encounter trolls with unique mini-games like rock-paper-scissors, tic-tac-toe, and riddles.
- **Custom Dice Mechanics**: A 4-sided die adds strategic variability to the game.
- **Player Customization**: Choose your character's name and color.
- **Audible and Visual Feedback**: Accessibility features include voice-guided messages and a visually engaging interface.

## Gameplay
- Players advance along a linear board, buying objects and interacting with obstacles.
- Each obstacle presents a mini-game that players must win or draw to continue.
- The game ends when all players still in the game reach the end of the board. The player with the highest combined balance and item worth wins.
